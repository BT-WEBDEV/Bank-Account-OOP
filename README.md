# Bank-Account-OOP

Case Use: A quick practice for Object Oriented Programming by created a bank acccount with a checking account. The bank account has a value stored in the balance. You can withdraw & deposit to change to change your balance. Can be expanded by adding a GUI. 

PLEASE READ THIS FIRST: Account.py runs the script. Each "person" in this case "Jack" & "John" have a balance of a $1000. When the script runs, a withdraw of $100 happens to each account along with a 1.00 fee. Each text document then changes to display the new amount in the account. 

This was a small quick learning project on classes, but could be expanded to include a working GUI.
